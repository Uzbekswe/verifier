# Photo Verification API

A production-style **selfie verification API** that mimics the pose-challenge system used by apps like Bumble and Tinder. It detects whether you're a real person (liveness check) and whether you correctly completed a pose challenge (look left, look right, smile, etc.).

Built with FastAPI, MediaPipe, and DeepFace. No custom model training required — everything uses pretrained weights.

---

## What It Does

The API runs a 3-stage pipeline on every submitted photo:

1. **Liveness Detection** — Uses DeepFace (MiniFASNet / Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing) to detect whether the image is a real live person or a printed photo / screen replay.
2. **Face Landmark Extraction** — Uses MediaPipe FaceLandmarker to extract 478 3D facial landmarks.
3. **Head Pose Estimation + Challenge Matching** — Solves a PnP (Perspective-n-Point) problem using OpenCV to compute yaw, pitch, and roll in degrees, then checks if the pose matches the requested challenge.

## Setup & Run

### Requirements
- macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- Python 3.12 (important — tensorflow does not support Python 3.14 yet)

### Install Python 3.12
```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

### Create virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
cd photo-app
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: `pip install` will also pull in `tensorflow`, `keras`, and other heavy dependencies through `deepface`. Total install is ~1.5GB. This is normal.

### Download the face landmark model
The MediaPipe face landmarker model is already included at `models/face_landmarker.task`. If you ever need to re-download it:
```bash
curl -L -o models/face_landmarker.task \
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task"
```

### Start the server
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The server starts on **http://localhost:8000**

---

## Testing

### Interactive API docs (recommended)
Open **http://localhost:8000/docs** in your browser. Swagger UI lets you call every endpoint, upload photos, and inspect responses without writing any code.

### Health check
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Full verification flow (terminal)

**Step 1 — Get a challenge:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/verify/challenge | python3 -m json.tool
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "challenge_id": "a3f2...",
  "challenge_type": "look_left",
  "instruction": "👈 Turn your head to the LEFT",
  "expires_in_seconds": 120
}
```

**Step 2 — Submit a selfie:**
```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "http://localhost:8000/verify/submit/look_left" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/photo.jpg" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Example response:
```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "challenge_type": "look_left",
  "liveness_score": 0.91,
  "liveness_passed": true,
  "pose_matched": true,
  "pose_angles": { "yaw": -22.4, "pitch": 1.2, "roll": 0.8 },
  "face_detected": true,
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "message": "✅ Verified! Challenge 'look_left' passed."
}
```

## How It Was Built

### Problem
Build a backend API that verifies a user is a real, live human and can perform an on-screen gesture — the same kind of challenge used in dating apps to prevent fake profile photos.

### Stack choices

**FastAPI** was chosen for its async support, automatic OpenAPI docs, and Pydantic validation — ideal for a photo-processing API where requests involve file uploads and structured JSON responses.

**MediaPipe FaceLandmarker** (Tasks API, v0.10.33) extracts 478 3D facial landmarks per frame. The newer Tasks API was used instead of the legacy `mp.solutions` because `mp.solutions` was removed in mediapipe >= 0.10.14. The pretrained `face_landmarker.task` model runs entirely on-device with no external API calls.

**Head Pose via PnP Solver** — Rather than training a pose estimation model, the implementation maps 6 stable MediaPipe landmarks (nose tip, chin, eye corners, mouth corners) to a known 3D canonical face model, then calls OpenCV's `solvePnP` to solve for the rotation vector. This is decomposed into yaw, pitch, and roll using Rodrigues + `decomposeProjectionMatrix`. No training data needed.

**DeepFace anti-spoofing** wraps MinivisionAI's Silent-Face-Anti-Spoofing (MiniFASNet). It classifies each face as real or spoof with a confidence score. Model weights download automatically from GitHub on first use (~4MB). A texture-based Laplacian variance fallback is included in case DeepFace fails.

**Python 3.12** is required because tensorflow 2.21 (a deepface dependency) does not yet have wheels for Python 3.14. The venv is built against `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12`.

### Key engineering decisions
- Models load once at startup via FastAPI's `lifespan` context — not on the first request — so the first API call is fast.
- MediaPipe and DeepFace run synchronously inside async route handlers (acceptable for single-user local use; would need `run_in_executor` for production concurrency).
- Liveness crops the face region with 15% padding before running anti-spoof, reducing background noise.
- Challenge thresholds (yaw, pitch, smile) are configurable in `app/core/config.py` without touching business logic.

---

## Configuration

Edit `app/core/config.py` to tune, or override any setting via a `.env` file (see `.env.example`):

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `YAW_THRESHOLD` | 15.0° | Degrees of head turn needed for look_left / look_right |
| `PITCH_THRESHOLD` | 12.0° | Degrees of tilt needed for look_up / look_down |
| `LIVENESS_THRESHOLD` | 0.6 | Minimum anti-spoof score to pass |
| `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE_MB` | 10 | Max upload size |
| `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION` | 4096 | Max image width or height in pixels |
| `CV_THREAD_POOL_SIZE` | 4 | Workers for blocking CV operations |
| `RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL` | 200/minute | Global rate limit per IP |
| `RATE_LIMIT_SUBMIT` | 10/minute | Rate limit on `/verify/submit` |
| `RATE_LIMIT_CHALLENGE` | 30/minute | Rate limit on `/verify/challenge` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | INFO | Python logging level |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | json | `json` for production, `text` for development |

---

## Production Features

This API is built production-grade out of the box:

- **Async CV execution** — MediaPipe, OpenCV, and DeepFace all run in a dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`CV_THREAD_POOL_SIZE` workers), keeping the asyncio event loop unblocked under concurrent load.

- **Structured JSON logging** — Every log line is emitted as JSON (via `python-json-logger`) with `request_id`, `logger`, `level`, and timing fields. Each request is assigned a correlation ID (from `X-Request-ID` header or auto-generated UUID) that propagates through all log lines for that request.

- **Rate limiting** — `slowapi` enforces configurable per-IP rate limits globally and per-endpoint. Limits are stored in memory by default and can be switched to Redis (`RATE_LIMIT_STORAGE_URI=redis://...`) for multi-instance deployments.

- **Prometheus metrics** at `/metrics` — `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` auto-instruments all routes. Domain-specific metrics include:
  - `verification_attempts_total` (by challenge type and result)
  - `cv_processing_seconds` (by pipeline stage: decode, face_analysis, liveness, total)
  - `liveness_score_distribution`

- **Typed error responses** — All errors return a consistent JSON shape `{ "error": { "error_code": "...", "message": "...", "request_id": "...", "context": {} } }` with machine-readable `error_code` values (`IMAGE_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_MIME_TYPE`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, etc.).

- **Input validation** — The `validated_image_bytes` dependency checks MIME type (JPEG/PNG/WebP only), file size, and image pixel dimensions (decompression bomb guard) before any CV processing begins.

- **API versioned under `/api/v1`** — All endpoints live at `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/verify/challenge`, and `/api/v1/verify/submit/{challenge_type}`.

- **`.env` support via pydantic-settings** — All settings can be overridden via environment variables or a `.env` file without touching source code. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to get started.
